## Factory Management & Automation

These games emphasize the building of assembly lines that consume input resources in order to produce output goods,
often with multiple chains of inputs to intermediary outputs.

### Factory Building

This subcategory has games that involve building an actual factory, usually by manually mining resources first and then
slowly adding automation.

Base game is incredibly deep, with lots to optimize. Mods add even more. | 

### Puzzle & Casual

These games distill the genre down to its core, stripping away the manual resource management and focusing on routing &
automation.

## Vehicle Building

These games let you create your own vehicle (whether a car, ship, aircraft, or otherwise) from parts and then simulate
its driving behaviors. Some have combat, while others are peaceful.

## City Builders & Civil Engineering

These games have a primary focus on city building and utilities infrastructure (electricity, sewer, water, garbage,
etc.). They are a typically blend of planning and economy management.

There is a separate category, Transportation, for games that primarily deal with route-building without the accompanying
city and economy management.

### Modern & Near-Future

These take place in the modern, post-industrial era with modern vehicles and power grids.

## Transportation & Route Management

These games turn the roads and rails of city builders into its own genre, with a focus on route-building, traffic
alleviation, and "traveling salesman" problems (finding the best route between points A, B, C, etc.).

## Survival & Settlement Builders, Colony Sims

Similar to city builders, but with a stronger focus on surviving harsh conditions and managing limited resources,
heat/cold, food, etc. In this genre, individual citizens are often more important and impactful, and the simulation is
more about the micro aspects of daily life than big-picture population growth.

## Open-World Survival Sandboxes

A sibling genre to colony sims, here you take direct control of one person (or a small group) to try to gather
resources, craft, and survive. While they don't all have the strongest engineering focus, most have at least building &
resource management aspects.

## Bridge-Building

These games focus on building semi-realistic (or not) bridges over cliffs, rivers, etc. with physics simulation and load
management. Different material strengths and stressors test your ability to build bridges that hold up under heavy use.

## Rube Goldberg Machines

These games replicate the "Incredible Machine" games of the 90s, where you build crazy contraptions out of everything
from lasers to ballons to cats, then use them in humorous ways to complete puzzles.

## Hacking, Computer Science, Logic & Automation

These games have a focus on programming and automation. Unlike factory games, they focus on optimizing repeatable sets
of actions rather than resource inputs. Some are graphical, while others require some light scripting/coding.

### Automation with Coding

This sub-genre with not many games is a blend of your typical factory game and coding game. Instead of building
automation using assembly lines with pickers, sorters, etc.,
you would actually write "code" (either real code or via graphical coding blocks) to optimize production.

### Electrical Engineering

Similar to programming games, but at a lower level in the machine. Wire circuits instead of writing code.

mundane (or exciting!) job.

I had great fun slapping wheels on something like a bathtub and making a makeshift car, or making silly Rube Goldberg style machines using levers, ropes, thrusters, etc. Not a typical game since it didn't offer any typical goals or levels outside of have fun and be creative, but that IMO only heightened the inspiration to engineer stuff to play with. |

## Narrative Storytelling Games

These adventure games are story-first, and may or may not have engineering in the primary gameplay mechanics. However,
they do have stories about or involving engineers.

Some story paths feature more engineering than others.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Instead of rigid puzzles you will learn (with the help from other characters in the game) how the reality of the game can be changed through programming and how any problem can be solved in whatever way you find suitable. |

## Everything else

These games defy easy categorization, but were "engineer-y" enough in some way to warrant inclusion
